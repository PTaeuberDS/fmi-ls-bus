The figure above shows one example for a network simulation architecture.
The importer is able to handle FMU input and output variables with network semantics:
The importer merges output clock activations, output binary data and output signal variables and forwards the results to their corresponding input variables.

The accuracy/performance of the resulting network simulation can range from ideal (no bandwidth restriction, no arbitration, no network errors) to more realistic (with restricted bandwidth, message delay due to arbitration, network errors, error injection, ...).
